# StockEasy - Inventory Management System

## Overview

StockEasy is a modern, full-stack inventory management system built for small to medium businesses. The application provides comprehensive tools for managing products, stock movements, suppliers, and operational checklists through an intuitive web interface.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript for type safety and modern development practices
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management and caching
- **UI Framework**: Shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theming support
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation for robust form handling
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript for end-to-end type safety
- **API Pattern**: RESTful API design with conventional HTTP methods
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database interactions
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (configured for Neon serverless)
- **Session Management**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL storage

### Multi-Tenancy Design
The system implements company-based multi-tenancy where:
- Each company has isolated data through `companyId` foreign keys
- Users belong to a specific company and can only access their company's data
- All database queries are scoped by company to ensure data isolation

## Key Components

### Database Schema
- **Companies**: Multi-tenant organization management
- **Users**: User accounts with role-based access (admin, manager, user)
- **Products**: Inventory items with supplier and category relationships
- **Stock Movements**: Transaction history for inventory changes (entrada/saida)
- **Suppliers**: Vendor management with contact information
- **Categories**: Product categorization system
- **Checklist System**: Operational task management with templates and executions

### Frontend Components
- **Layout System**: Responsive sidebar navigation with mobile support
- **Dashboard**: Real-time statistics and low stock alerts
- **Product Management**: CRUD operations with filtering and search
- **Movement Tracking**: Stock transaction history and new movement creation
- **Supplier Management**: Contact and vendor information management
- **Checklist System**: Daily operational task management
- **WhatsApp Integration**: Shopping list generation for procurement

### API Endpoints
- **Dashboard**: `/api/dashboard/stats` - Business metrics and KPIs
- **Products**: Full CRUD operations with company scoping
- **Movements**: Stock transaction management
- **Suppliers**: Vendor information management
- **Checklists**: Operational task template and execution management
- **WhatsApp**: Shopping list generation for low stock items

## Data Flow

### Authentication Flow
1. User authentication handled through mock middleware (designed for future Supabase integration)
2. User context includes company ID for data scoping
3. All API requests include user context for authorization

### State Management Flow
1. React Query manages all server state with automatic caching
2. Optimistic updates for improved user experience
3. Real-time data synchronization through query invalidation
4. Form state managed locally with React Hook Form

### Database Interaction Flow
1. API routes validate user permissions and extract company context
2. Drizzle ORM executes type-safe queries with company scoping
3. Data returned with proper type inference throughout the stack
4. Automatic relationship loading for complex queries

```

## User Preferences

```
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Database preference: Supabase (complete migration from Neon) for integrated RLS, authentication, and long-term maintainability.
Priority: Multi-tenant SaaS authentication with proper company isolation through Supabase Auth + RLS.
Architecture concern: Clear separation between authentication users and business users in multi-tenant structure.
```

## Multi-Tenant Architecture Clarification

### Current Authentication Flow Issues
- Confusion between Supabase Auth users and internal business users
- Users created in frontend don't sync to Supabase Auth
- Need clear hierarchy: Super Admin → Company Admin → Company Users

### Required Architecture
1. **Super Admin Level**: Manages multiple companies, creates company admins
2. **Company Admin Level**: Manages their company's users and data
3. **Company User Level**: Regular users with role-based permissions within company
4. **Authentication**: All users authenticate through Supabase, but business logic separates concerns
